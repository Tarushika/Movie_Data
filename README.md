Objective:-
The objective of this project is to analyze and reconstruct the schema of a movie-related database using reverse engineering techniques to understand its structure and relationships better.I make a Project in SQL where I perform a Reverse Engineering of movie data. 

Scope:-
The project focuses on the schema of a movie database, including tables for movies, actors, directors, and user reviews. The goal is to visualize and validate the database structure and identify potential improvements.

Definition:-
Reverse engineering involves examining an existing database to reconstruct its schema, including tables, relationships, and constraints, to understand its design and structure.

Tool Used:-
MySQL Workbench: For reverse engineering the database schema and creating ER diagrams.

Methodology:-
Connected to the existing movie database using MySQL Workbench.Extracted the schema using the "Reverse Engineer" feature, which generated an initial ER diagram.

Schema Analysis:-
Analyzed tables, columns, and their relationships. Identified primary and foreign keys.
